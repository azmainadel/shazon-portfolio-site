**Abstract:**<br>
Methylammonium lead halide (MAPbI3) is widely used as perovskite absorber material in thin-film solar cell technology because of its eminent cell performance. Recently, formamidinium lead iodide perovskite (FAPbI<sub>3</sub>) has received great attention because of its optimum bandgap value closer to the infrared single junction range. In this paper, a suitable combination of hole transporting material (HTM) and electron transporting material (ETM) is determined to achieve higher efficiency compared to existing structures utilizing an FAPbI<sub>3</sub> absorber. The proposed structure uses two stable metal oxides as HTM (NiOùëã) and ETM (SnO<sub>2</sub>). A comparative numerical analysis of solar cell performance is shown among four different HTM materials using the Solar Cell Capacitor Simulator (SCAPS-1D). Performance evaluation is also carried out for three different compositions of FAPbI3 having different band gaps with respect to absorber thickness. Optimized absorber thickness, HTM and ETM doping density, and absorber defect density are enumerated using numerical simulation. By deploying the optimized parameters, maximum power conversion efficiency is found to be 26.23%. Later on, effects of ùëÖ<sub>series</sub> and ùëÖ<sub>shunt</sub> on ideal solar cell performance are analyzed using numerical simulation.
