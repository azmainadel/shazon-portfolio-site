**Abstract:**<br>
The objective of this paper is to mitigate overfrequency problem of a low inertia power system using
coordinated Over-Frequency Generator Shedding (OFGS)
scheme. Recently, prolific amount of wind resources has been
introduced in many power systems around the world. These
variable speed wind power plants cannot contribute to system
inertia unlike traditional synchronous generators. This leads
to insufficient system inertia and the system can be termed as
low inertia power system. If an area is transporting
significant amount of power to adjacent area, then tripping of
interconnection line can cause excess power thus to increase
the system frequency in that area. This research work
proposes a method to mitigate this problem using overfrequency generator tripping scheme. Results show that
tripping wind turbine generator provides the best system
response if single generator tripping scheme is undertaken. In
case of double generator tripping scheme, wind-hydro
combination tripping demonstrates the lowest frequency
summit, lower Rate of Change of Frequency (ROCOF) and
faster settling time. Finally, generators having different
inertia constants are tripped to portray that generators
having lower inertia constant should be tripped first.
