**Abstract:**<br>
Lead halide based perovskite solar cells achieve a promising efficiency which exceeds 20%. However, due to the toxicity of lead it is unsuitable for wide application. Rather, lead-free absorber, CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>SnI<sub>3</sub> is a preferable choice for solar energy harvesting. In this work, a numerical analysis is presented for a planar PSC structure with CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>SnI<sub>3</sub> as an absorber, CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>SnBr<sub>3</sub> as a hole transporting layer and aluminum-doped zinc oxide as an electron transporting layer. The performance evaluation is done by varying the thickness and defect density of the absorber layer as well as the doping densities of the charge carrier transporting layers. The optimum thickness and defect density of the absorber layer are obtained to be 800 nm and 10<sup>13</sup>cm<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. The optimum doping density for the charge carrier transporting layers is 10<sup>21</sup>cm<sup>-3</sup>, After optimization, the final cell efficiency is found to be 19.34%.
