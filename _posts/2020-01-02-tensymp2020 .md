**Abstract:**<br>
Lead halide based perovskite solar cells achieve a
promising efficiency which exceeds 20%. However, due to the
toxicity of lead it is unsuitable for wide application. Rather,
lead-free absorber, CH3NH3SnI3 is a preferable choice for solar
energy harvesting. In this work, a numerical analysis is
presented for a planar PSC structure with CH3NH3SnI3 as an
absorber, CH3NH3SnBr3 as a hole transporting layer and
aluminum-doped zinc oxide as an electron transporting layer.
The performance evaluation is done by varying the thickness
and defect density of the absorber layer as well as the doping
densities of the charge carrier transporting layers. The optimum
thickness and defect density of the absorber layer are obtained
to be 800 nm and 1013 cm-3, respectively. The optimum doping
density for the charge carrier transporting layers is 1021 cm-3.
After optimization, the final cell efficiency is found to be
19.34%.
